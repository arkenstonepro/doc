OutRights ::


  The term outrights is used in the forex (FX) market to describe a type of transaction
  where two parties agree to buy or sell a given amount of currency at a predetermined rate at some point in the future.
  This type of transaction is also referred to as a forward outright,an FX forward or currency forward.
  A forward outright transaction is mainly used by parties seeking to hedge against adverse currency
  luctuations or to stabilize a stream of future cash flows by taking advantage of the current rate.

  主要在FX 市场上面使用，用于描述一例交易类型， 双方协议在未来某个时间段以一个预先设定好的汇率买卖货币， 也叫 forward outright, 或者 FX Forward
  或者 currency forward, 主要在交易双方规避风险工具。

  OutRight rate 和 Spot market 市场使用的是不一样的：

  An outright rate differs from the rate used in the spot market
  because the parties factor in characteristics such as
  1. the volatility of the currencies and
  2. their mutual opinion of where they think the exchange rate will be in the future.

  The disadvantage of using a forward outright is that
  1. the exchange rate could move in what would have been a favorable direction had the hedge not been implemented.

  In this case, the investor doesn't stand to gain from favorable changes in the exchange rate
  because they agreed to pay a predetermined exchange rate regardless of the rate
  when the investor makes the purchase.
