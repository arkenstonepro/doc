从订单到持仓
-----------------------

单子在最佳价格成交后， 便转换成 Trade, 成交记录将被传递给下游， 做清算结算

::

  Clearing is the activity of determining obligations,
  after which the obligations are discharged by settlement prior to the  the next trading session.





Order Aggressor Indicator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

流动性消耗者， 这样的单子是抽走流动性，变相导致价格波动，点差拉大， 每次单子的成交，都会触发这个检查和报告：

1. Order Entry
2. Market Data
3. Post-Matching/Clearing

盘前，盘后不会触发相关检查。
